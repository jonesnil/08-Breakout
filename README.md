# 08-Breakout
For this project I tried to quickly redo the past few godot projects without actually tracing the notes. A lot of the scripts
are reused, but I kind of patched them together from the original product as I went, and I made a few changes when I couldn't
understand how it worked in the original.I think I learned a lot about how the scripts are functioning by debugging it as I put
it together. I also changed the assets up a little bit to some I made, and I plan to improve them a lot for the next step,
this part just took longer than I thought it would so I didn't have time.

Oh, and if you stumbled on this without knowing the context somehow, this is a simple breakout game in Godot.
